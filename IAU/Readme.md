#### Semestral project for subject Intelligent Data Analysis on [FIIT STU](https://www.fiit.stuba.sk/en.html?page_id=749)

We received training datasets of patients with thyroid disease and based on the values in tables, we had to do a prediction of protein levels on testing datasets. 

The project contains 3 phases:
1. Research analysis of received data
2. Preprocessing of data
3. Design of optimal classification algorithm (decision tree) to predict protein level based on input values
